Introduction to Machine Learning 1.1 Definition and importance of ML : Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. 1.2 Types of machine learning: a) Supervised Learning Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data. This means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn to map inputs to the correct outputs. • Common Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Neural Networks. b) Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data. The goal is to identify patterns and structures within the data. • Common Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering,\n",
