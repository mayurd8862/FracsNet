what is Machine Learning," Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that uses data and algorithms to imitate human learning, gradually improving its accuracy. It can be categorized into three main types: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data to map inputs to correct outputs, using common algorithms like Linear Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). SVM is a powerful supervised algorithm that works best on smaller datasets but can handle complex ones. It's used for both regression and classification tasks but performs better in classification problems.",41.92972540855408
who is the Prime minister of India," I'm an AI and don't have real-time knowledge about current events or persons. The Prime Minister of India, as of my last update, is Narendra Modi. However, for the most accurate information, I recommend checking the latest sources such as news websites or official government portals.",15.432805299758911
what is ensemble learning technique," Ensemble learning techniques are a group of machine learning strategies that combine multiple models to improve overall performance. Examples include Bagging (Random Forests) and Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machines, XGBoost, LightGBM). These methods help reduce variance, bias, or improve predictions by combining the outputs of various models.",20.321431636810303
what is PCA," Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used in unsupervised learning, which transforms data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much variance as possible by computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.",13.853622674942017
who is the founder of Tesla," The question asks for the founder of Tesla, which is not directly related to the context provided. However, Elon Musk is one of the founders of Tesla Motors (now known as Tesla, Inc.).",11.011332750320435
