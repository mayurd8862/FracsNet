what is ensemble learning technique,"Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple models to improve overall performance by reducing variance, bias, or improving predictions. It can be achieved through bagging or boosting methods, where the latter involves sequentially training models to correct errors. Ensemble methods aim to create a stronger model by averaging or voting on the predictions of individual models.",9.966707468032837
what is PCA,"I don't know. According to the context, PCA is described as a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much variance as possible, but there is no explicit question about its usefulness or application.",6.579927444458008
