      "High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a leading risk factor for serious cardiac conditions such as stroke, heart attack and premature death.  High blood pressure may show no symptoms yet puts you at increased risk for potentially catastrophic health events. One important step in controlling high blood pressure is to optimize nitric oxide (NO) production through lifestyle changes. NO diffuses into the smooth muscle cells that line arteries and promotes proper vessel relaxation (vasodilation), improves blood flow and blood pressure balance. Lifestyle factors focused on reducing inflammation and managing stress also help to lower elevated blood pressure. Eighty percent of nitric oxide dietary intake comes from vegetables and water. Nitric oxide production begins in the mouth.  Hypertension risk factors include obesity, poor diet (high sodium and saturated fat), drinking too much alcohol, smoking, chronic stress, chronic kidney dysfunction, hormone imbalances, race (high blood pressure is particularly common among Black people), and increasing age.  Systolic blood pressure, the first reported number, represents the pressure exerted on the arterial walls when the heart is pumping. Diastolic blood pressure, the second reported number, represents the pressure exerted on the arterial walls between heart beats. Normal blood pressure has a systolic reading less than 120 and a diastolic reading less than 80. Elevated blood pressure has a systolic reading of 120-129 and a diastolic reading less than 80. Stage 1 hypertension has a systolic reading of 130-139 and a diastolic reading of 80-89. Stage 2 hypertension has a systolic reading of 140-179 and a diastolic reading of 90-119. Hypertensive crisis has a systolic reading greater than 180 and a diastolic reading greater than 120.\n",

      "Eat Frequent, Small Meals: Eating a big meal leads to the shunting of blood toward the gut. For patients who experience dizziness or lightheadedness when they stand up (called orthostatic intolerance), it is advisable to eat frequent, small meals.  \n",
      "Increase Dietary Fiber: Fiber acts as a binder that removes a variety of unwanted organisms and toxins from the body. Slowly increase your daily fiber intake, creating an individualized daily goal with your clinician.  \n",
      "Increase Salt Intake: Increase your intake of Himalayan or Celtic sea salt to boost fluid volume in the body, which helps stabilize blood pressure.  \n",
      "Increase Water Intake: Drinking a proper amount of water can alleviate strain on the cardiovascular system. Aim for a light-yellow urine color to indicate that you are properly hydrated.  \n",
      "Improve Vagal Tone: For one or two minutes in the morning and evening, gargle water or practice humming and singing. Adding meditation, breathing techniques or cold water therapy to your daily routine improves vagal tone, which aids body functions during rest and digestion.  \n",

      "The eye is the organ most susceptible to oxidative damage caused by light, toxins (smoke), and atmospheric oxygen. The formula includes potent antioxidants and key nutrients to protect the eyes from free radical damage and maintain the long-term health of the eyes. Lipoic acid , a potent, versatile antioxidant, 'recharges' other vital antioxidants such as vitamins E and C and glutathione. The carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin are found in high concentrations in the macula lutea portion of the eye. These strong antioxidants have been shown to protect the lens protein, lipid membranes, and DNA from oxidative damage to help improve visual acuity. Zinc , a vital coenzyme for eye tissue, is a necessary component in antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase.  Zinc also stimulates the enzymes responsible for digesting rod outer segments and preventing the build-up of lipofuscin, a lipid-containing residue caused by normal 'wear and tear' that can impair vision. premier nutritional support for the eyes † Dietary Supplement 60 Capsules\n",

      "Rhodiola rosea root extract is categorized as an adaptogenic botanical due to its ability to increase resistance to variety of stressors. Within the central nervous system, Rhodiola has been shown to preserve levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. Eleuthero root extract is a strong adaptogenic botanical widely used in China to support general health, memory and endurance. In addition to improving stress resilience and fighting fatigue, Eleuthero has exhibited immune supporting effects. Schisandra berry extract is a botanical used for centuries in China and Russia to help support mental clarity, stress response and emotional health. Licorice root extract promotes healthy cortisol levels by inhibiting an enzyme that converts cortisol to its inactive form, cortisone.

      "Adren-All® is a powerful formulation that helps support the body's resistance to fatigue and aids in maintaining balanced cortisol and DHEA levels in times of prolonged stress. Rhodiola rosea root extract has been shown to preserve levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. In addition to improving stress resilience and fighting fatigue, Eleuthero root extract has exhibited immune supporting effects. Schisandra berry extract is a botanical used for centuries in China and Russia to help support mental clarity, stress response and emotional wellness. Licorice root extract promotes healthy cortisol levels by inhibiting an enzyme that converts cortisol to its inactive form, cortisone. This is important for individuals who need support for maintaining healthy inflammatory balance. Adrenal concentrate has been used in medicine for thousands of years. The concept of glandular support holds that similar organ extracts from animals will enhance the same organ within humans by stimulating its activity and providing concentrated nutrients specific to the organ. 60 Capsules Dietary Supplement † ® Adren-All ENDOCRINE HEALTH 5pt SUGG USE 8pt NET QTY DIET SUPP FDA STMT\n",

      "Stress is defined as any disturbance (extreme cold or heat, psychological stress, sleep deprivation, work overload, physical trauma, or toxic exposure) that triggers the stress response in the body. AdreneVive® includes L-theanine , an amino acid found naturally in green tea, which promotes a calm and centered state of relaxation by promoting alpha brain wave activity. In addition, phosphatidylserine prevents stress-induced hyperexcretion of cortisol. Ashwagandha root extract improves stress resilience, helps promote a healthy sleep cycle and thyroid function, and protects against exhaustion of the nervous system. Rhodiola rosea root extract has been shown to preserve levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. Eleuthero root extract and Scutellaria baicalensis , or skullcap root , are strong adaptogenic botanicals and have been shown to improve stress resilience and maintain immune balance.

Because of its cholesterol-balancing role, HMG-CoA reductase is a target of many traditional therapies, but studies indicate these therapies deplete the metabolic reserve of several critical nutrients and do not provide an antioxidant benefit. 1\n",

      "Optimizing cardiovascular health is a leading concern for many adults, and maintaining balanced cholesterol levels is an important part of that process. Though cholesterol can be consumed through food, circulating cholesterol levels are primarily produced and controlled by the liver using the rate control enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Because of its pronounced role in cholesterol synthesis, inhibiting HMGCR has become a primary target of many traditional therapies. Bergamot (Citrus bergamia) is a citrus plant that grows almost exclusively in the narrow coastal Calabria region in southern Italy. The local population quickly discovered bergamot juice could be used to help support healthy cholesterol levels and optimize cardiovascular wellness. Bergamot BPF's health benefits derive from its unique profile of phenolic compounds such as neoeriocitrin, neohesperidin and naringin. Naringin has been shown to be beneficial in maintaining healthy inflammatory balance while neoeriocitrin has been found to exhibit a strong capacity to quench free radicals and maintain healthy LDL cholesterol levels. Also, bergamot naturally contains large amounts of brutieridin and melitidin, which have a unique ability to dampen HMG-CoA reductase. 12pt 5pt 5pt 5pt FOOTNOTE 5pt OTHER INGREDIENT SFB BODY\n",

      "Phospholipids are an integral part of biological membranes, and they tend to decrease as we age. They are critical for cell and mitochondrial membrane shape, repair and growth. Proper cell membrane function facilitates healthy cell signaling, which is important for energy production, immune function and regulating inflammatory cascades. BioPC Pro® leverages the benefits of a full-spectrum blend of phosphatides, including phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine , , phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine , to bolster parasympathetic tone in patients who may be sympathetic-dominant. These phosphatides help achieve nervous system balance and provide a vital choline source to help optimize acetylcholine levels, which can be compromised in sympathetic dominance. In addition, BioPC Pro® helps process fats and supports better focus, brain health, and cognitive function. This high-concentration phosphatide blend is naturally bioavailable and rapidly absorbed. Adding BioPC Pro® to a smoothie creates a creamy texture and is an easy way to get all the benefits of a full-spectrum phosphatide blend! 16pt TITLE 8pt 8pt 8pt FOOTNOTE 8pt OTHER INGREDIENT SFB BODY HEADING SUPPLEMENT FACTS FOR OFFICE USE ONLY FONT POINT SIZES\n",

C-Flav also helps maintain normal inflammatory balance throughout the body. Humans lack the enzyme required to synthesize vitamin C and, therefore, must obtain the vitamin from their diets. Vitamin C is crucial for a wide range of biological processes including immune system function, skin health, blood vessel and artery strength, and gum health. C-Flav includes a powerful blend of vitamin C hibiscus , , and acerola fruit juice concentrate , plus the distinctive bioflavonoids quercetin and rutin .

      "More than 70% of the body's immune system resides in the gut, so establishing a healthy microbial balance is critical for reducing immune challenges and maintaining healthy inflammatory balance. Biotin helps to establish microbial balance by preventing yeast, especially Candida albicans , from converting to its more invasive fungal form. In addition, sodium caprylate is included to disrupt the metabolism of Candida and create a hostile environment for colonization. The potent botanicals oregano and Pau D'Arco have similar microbial-balancing properties. Berberine, an alkaloid derived from plant roots, also has been found to reduce the adherence of Candida albicans in the GI tract. In addition, cinnamon ginger , , and chamomile are carminative agents that help soothe the GI lining while improving microbial balance. 5pt 5pt 5pt 14pt TITLE 6pt SFB BODY SUPPLEMENT FACTS FOR OFFICE USE ONLY FONT POINT SIZES\n",

      "Methylation is a vitamin-requiring biochemical process in the body critical for maintaining mental and physical health. Methylation helps convert the problematic amino acid metabolite homocysteine into the amino acids methionine and cysteine. Consistent recycling of homocysteine is vital for supporting cardiovascular health. Proper methylation can be inhibited by nutrient deficiencies in folic acid, B6 and B12. Certain medications such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen and oral contraceptives can also deplete blood levels of these crucial B vitamins, reducing the body's vital methylation capacity. Adequate levels of folic acid and vitamin B12 are considered two of the most important nutrients required to balance homocysteine levels. They work together in several processes, including synthesis of DNA and red blood cells, and the maintenance of the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells. Vitamin B6 works with folic acid and vitamin B12 in the recycling of homocysteine. Betaine (trimethylglycine) contributes to the recycling process, and also functions in the body as a methyl donor. Cardio B specifically targets homocysteine recycling 5pt 7pt 13pt TITLE 6pt 6pt 6pt FOOTNOTE 5pt OTHER INGREDIENT SFB BODY HEADING SUPPLEMENT FACTS FOR OFFICE USE ONLY FONT POINT SIZES\n",

      "Estrogen collectively refers to female hormones that carry chemical messages to cells throughout the body. The hormones deliver the important message of 'grow, divide and multiply.' It is for this reason that hormones are vital in human development and tissue repair. Supporting proper estrogen synthesis, metabolism and detoxification is essential for proper hormonal balance. I3C helps achieve this goal through its ability to temper estrogen signals by competing for binding sites and inhibiting the activity of estrogen receptors. The second phytonutrient compound, DIM , promotes beneficial estrogen metabolism in both sexes and enhances the potential for greater antioxidant activity. Calcium D-glucarate is the supplemental calcium salt form of D-glucaric acid, a substance found naturally in the body and in consumption of certain fruits and vegetables. Calcium D-glucarate has been extensively studied and shown to inhibit beta-glucaronidase, an enzyme found in certain gut bacteria. This activity supports the body's ability to detoxify estrogens, foreign molecules and fat-soluble toxins.\n",

The formula is composed of magnesium L-threonate, magnesium acetyl taurinate and magnesium glycerophosphate-three highly bioavailable forms of magnesium that increase systemic and brain magnesium concentration. Magnesium L-threonate is a magnesium salt from which the threonate can associate with the glucose transporters (GLUTs) on the blood-brain barrier to enhance transportation of magnesium into the brain. Magnesium acetyl taurinate and magnesium glycerophosphate work synergistically to support mitochondrial ATP production and promote structural integrity of the brain.\n",

High levels of stress, dietary deficiencies, genetics, medications and toxins all play a role in neurotransmitter depletion. The nutrients in Cerenity® support healthy neurotransmitter levels for balancing the stress response. L-theanine , an amino acid found in green tea, has been shown to quickly improve stress perception and resilience. PharmaGABA™ , a patented and naturally sourced form of GABA, has been shown to promote relaxation in the central nervous system. 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is an amino acid intermediate that is directly converted into the mood-regulating neurotransmitter serotonin. Taurine is an amino acid that activates GABA receptors. Inositol is crucial for the release of neurotransmitters from within nerve cells. The essential micronutrients included in Cerenity® aid in the synthesis of serotonin and GABA. The support of these neurotransmitters helps promote a relaxed mental state, positive outlook and restful sleep cycle.\n",
